# 1. Introduction
This README document provides an overview of a student dataset and outlines the steps taken for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the development of a Linear Regression model. The goal is to analyze the dataset and build a model that predicts a student's academic performance based on various features.

# 2. Dataset Overview
1. Dataset Name: Studentscore.csv
2. Data Source: Kaggle
3. Data Description: The dataset contains information about students, including features such as marks and hours.

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Data Preprocessing
1. Missing Data: Check for missing values and handle them if necessary.
2. Data Cleaning: Remove any outliers or irrelevant data points.
3. Feature Engineering: Create new features if needed.

# Data Exploration
1. Univariate Analysis: Explore individual features using histograms, box plots, etc.
2. Bivariate Analysis: Investigate relationships between features and the target variable.
3. Multivariate Analysis: Examine correlations between features and identify any patterns.

# 4. Linear Regression Model

# Data Splitting
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

# Model Training
1. Use linear regression to build a predictive model.
2. Train the model using the training dataset.
3. Perform hyperparameter tuning if necessary.

# Model Evaluation
1. Evaluate the Linear Regression model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
2. Visualize the model's predictions against the actual values.
3. Interpret the coefficients of the Linear Regression model to understand the importance of each feature.

# 5. Conclusion
In conclusion, this project involves the analysis of a student dataset to understand factors that influence academic performance and the development of a Linear Regression model to predict student performance. By following the steps outlined in this README, you will be able to perform EDA, preprocess the data, train a Linear Regression model, and evaluate its performance.
